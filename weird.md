# GENERAL (ANONYMOUS)

I had a 💨 dream I was eating a Wendy's meatless meat burger 🤷‍♂️ in the parking lot. I
sat on the step leading to the entrance as 2 of my housemates struggled to start
a car propped up on a hill in the adjacent woods 🌲.

Paris Hilton was hanging out - whatever - and I thought to ask her out (in real life
she's not my type... really 💀 Would not date her if she were interested) and was
rejected 🤕. She was kicking rocks with a few guys I can only describe as nondescript
and she was dressed like a 5 year-old (a black rainbow unicorn sweater 👧🏼 ).

My 2 housemates eventually pulled up with smiles and a working vehicle 🚗. I got in
(I think) and we left. Earlier I was explaining to Charlie Batch 🏈 how VR worked in
a car in Pittsburgh and Mark Zuckerburg 🤖 jumped in the backseat unannounced with some
off-brand VR headset 👀 I asked him was it Oculus and he didn't reply as if embarrassed.

# A COMPUTER SCIENCE THEORY OF ETERNITY

## _Side Thoughts on Using C.S. to Model Humans as Beings Distinct from Bodies_

#### David Oliver Doswell

> Suppositions

- Physics is a crude atomic programming interface (ATPI) for the known universe

- There is no beginning to the known universe

- The observable universe is a physical observation

- Time is a physical construct

- Time does not exist in non-physical constructs

- Human animals are physical constructs

- Human “beings” are non-physical constructs

- “Beings” (Entities) exist inside of (bodies) and outside of time


#### Primitives

- Function that outputs biological life to “Beings”

- Redefine death as a “Transition Display Module”

- Establish eternity exists in a poorly understood visual interface adjacent the
physical universe, via an ATPI.

> Establish: Dimension. Existence. Body. Consciousness. Communication. Runtime.
