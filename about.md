Hello, San Francisco ðŸ‘‹

Lambda House Weekly is a satirical news blog and job board.

The publication primarily focuses on the lives of the iOS I students participating
in Lambda School's **Lambda House I** experiment in San Francisco, California.

Expect jokes, tabloid fodder, career advice, and ass-naked insight into how many
potatoes these new students can eat, before peripheral circulatory collapse sets
in with the solanine and kills them.
