Hello, San Francisco 👋

Lambda House Weekly is a satirical news blog and job board.

The publication primarily focuses on the lives of the iOS I students participating
in Lambda School's **Lambda House I** experiment in San Francisco, California.

Expect jokes, tabloid fodder, job advice, and skin-naked insight into how many
potatoes these new students will eat, before peripheral circulatory collapse sets
in with the solanine and kills them.

Happy reading 👨‍🚀
