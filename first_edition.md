# SCHOOL IS HARD

I said to my good friend, Joe, the above title in a text message, and he scoffed, “School is not hard… school is a filter to see who can commit to something and who can’t.”

I initially found the response vanquishing and militant, as if I were applying to _Treadstone_ to help take down Carlos the Jackal.

His response both angered and accelerated me to persist the next day. I replied, “I can and I will,” with the gusto of a young cadet who doesn’t stop to think that his flag is made out of the same material as the enemy’s. My reply to Joe was at best ambitious.

This is the third week at Lambda School and I could peel the skin from my flesh and feel nothing. I am not certain what is particularly difficult. Students use the word “rigorous” to distinguish what they relay to people from the pain they are feeling inside. It is disingenuous and broke but it works. For, like, 5 seconds. The student will know pain. Rigor indeed describes our curriculum but it is more than that (see: Feature Requests).

The week was especially trying and we haven’t scaled a month with 6 more to go. But it’s Friday. I have a half bottle of Côtes du Rhône and an I don’t care attitude. I am interested in a walk and talk with a beautiful woman. Maybe visit the bodega on Mission. Or an acupuncturist. Or an exorcist.

Thoughts and prayers to my housemates, most of whom are working on their Sprint Challenge post-submission time. Dinner should be replete with various odors from all the diets with a dash of vitriol about the origins of pedagogy.

# I LOVE SAN FRANCISCO

San Francisco is high on pot and its own self-worth. That may be earned but it doesn’t account for the intoxicating smell of fresh poop next to the comic book store. Or Louis Vuitton in Union Square. And yet, I embrace these colorful wonders over the industrial, silver cigarette smoke of Downtown Pittsburgh.
The weather is nice no matter how chilly the mornings and evenings. I personally sleep well beside a cool breeze. The neighborhood is quiet until it isn’t. The people are appropriately nice and then on their way, and the sun gives them a glow I fantasized only existed in California. Dreams do come true.

Shout out to the guy sleeping 5 yards from my gated residence to whose couch pillow I gifted a former housemate’s hoody. He wasn’t there when I came back outside to drop it off but that shit was gone after class when I furtively peeked out the window. I saw him under the tree later wearing it. We can do better, SF.   

#### FEATURE REQUESTS

# ANONYMOUS

**A 4th Working Burner** Building guy came this Friday morning. Rang the doorbell 5 times while I was figuring out the data type to my JSONDecoder(). Scared the shit out of me. He was nice, barely spoke English, laughed after every unintelligible sentence, and only capped 1 of 2 no-pilot burners.

**Dining Area** We will probably combine unused work desks for the kitchen but this was brought up. 3 of us are just big guys. 2 of us could have won The Battle of Bannockburn with William Wallace.

**School Psychologist** PMs are not motivators or comforters (though ours, Jacob M., is the next best thing to a young doctor with an exquisite bedside manner). A proper mental health professional is expensive. And maybe not necessary. But I imagine there are people who would like to talk to someone without feeling like they’re being handled and put back on the horse by an instructor or project manager.
