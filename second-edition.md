# A SPRINT IS NOT A MARATHON

The popular saying, paraphrased above, to encourage long-term thinking, is only
encouraging after the fact. It is not particularly helpful in the moment. The
thick of trial and tribulation is an atmosphere not dissimilar to Karl The Fog:
chilly, out of context, notably distracting when you need to see things clearly.

This week's Sprint Challenge should be no different than last week's in that it
was a _Sprint Challenge_. Every week at Lambda School we are (somewhat) evaluated
on our weekly progress to assess our readiness to move on to the next week. I was...
not ready. To be honest, I am beginning to feel a little overwhelmed. The slanted
issue I am facing is my shortcomings have nothing to do with the lessons taught.

The instructor is exceptional.

I understand what I am hearing except being asked to reproduce it is like the Kevin
Hart bit with the remedial student. A young child is told what the answer is to 1 + 1
after having the base 10 numeral system explained to him (1, 2, 3... etc.)

However, when asked to repeat the answer, upon being asked, the child weeps incessantly
before declaring "I don't know!!!," without guile, as if he hadn't recently been taught
how to think about the problem.

I feel, as my housemate remarked, "You should be coding, right now!," that I should
be coding right now, to better refine what I have been teaching myself for 3 years.

I know this stuff but I don't test well. I'm like the remedial student except instead
of crying, I pregame in my bedroom like a bridesmaid, go to the Haight, and look for
trouble. But I have to think long term and what is best for my education. This is only
week 3 and I am already complaining.

This week's Sprint challenge was a big fat incomplete, resulting in my (maybe!) having
to repeat the week, again. I am working to prove that I am in need of no such thing by
rebuilding the projects from scratch and completing them. I wish they asked me 'What is
1 + 1.' That would demonstrate my genius.

#### EDITORIAL

# TCHAIKOVSKY SYMPHONY 4

Ah, late 19th century Moscow. The cold. The Byzantine architecture. The grandeur of
the cupolas. The posterity soon to relish the beauty of the symphony as they nosh on
buttery Welsh cakes. Yes, a cohort of Lambda House students may be found sat around a
vintage record player spinning the albums of the masters in their blue jeans. They may
also be stuffed with fried British staples with little regard for their cholesterol or
the people sleeping downstairs.

The Monero Meetup one housemate attended was profitable. Heaps of good information from
one visible community Schelling point, known on Twitter as Fluffy Pony. Having recently
attended a conference in Panama, it is not surprising to hear many wealthy individuals
define crypto, as Pony related, as "the new offshore." Seeing different aspects of San
Francisco is interesting. So many little neighborhoods doing so many different things.
But they all unify around a common good: unlike the technical knowledge (and wealth) of
crypto, the smell of poop and pot is evenly distributed.

Let's be clear: Lambda House students do not own their House. We are fortunate to be here.
And we are not lost on that fact. However, it is always... an adaptive segue from living
on your own (or even with other people) to having your landlord show your living quarters
to whom you would call strangers without warning. It's like living in a menagerie except
no one feeds you or washes you up, which is a total ripoff.

Speaking of The Group, the weekend get-togethers continue. Lambda House kids are squarely
uninvited though we would probably not be turned away were we to crash the party (as I had
a few weeks ago). But the kids are starting to feel it. Sure, we make our own fun, on and off
premise, but we are pariahs. The Group is distant and civil as if we were terminally ill.
Group spawn, A. and S., however, who co-exist with us, are solid. And to be honest so are
the others. Plainly, there is no need for The Group to invest any quality time into us, as
our days are numbered (more on that, later).

#### FEATURE REQUESTS

# ANONYMOUS

**Mail Forwarding** A housemate and I have enjoyed the quality of bedding and home magazines
that arrive 1 to 2 times per week from previous residents. I imagine a young D.I.N.K. (Dual
Income No Kids) couple, planning a family, deciding San Francisco was too expensive a place
to raise a child, and saying 'Fuck that, we out, baby!' without canceling their subscription
to Country Sampler.

**Special Thanks**
